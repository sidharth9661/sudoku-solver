# Sudoku Solver
This is a Sudoku Solver project that uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and C++ to solve Sudoku puzzles. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to recursively test different values until a solution is found.

# Getting Started
To use the Sudoku Solver, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a Sudoku puzzle to solve. To enter a value, click on a cell and type in the number you want to add. To erase a value, click on the cell and press the delete key.

Once you have entered your puzzle, click on the "Solve" button to solve the puzzle. The solver will display the completed puzzle in the grid.

# Dependencies
The Sudoku Solver requires a modern web browser with support for HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional dependencies are required.
